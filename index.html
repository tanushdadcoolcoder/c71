        <p class="text-muted">Berachah Church was founded by C. W. Colgan, an oil company executive, who created it to evangelize Christianity. In 1950, Robert Thieme came to Berachah. Thieme met with the Board of Deacons at the close of his first Sunday service and recommended that they resign immediately. The board accepted this and from that moment on, according to Joe Wall, Thieme "became the dominant leader who brooked no challenge to his authority."[2] Thieme was pastor at Berachah until he retired in 2003, at which time his only son, Robert "Bobby" Thieme III, was elected by the congregation of Berachah to serve as the new pastor.[3]</p>

      consider,canteens must be more organized and more efficient than they have been in the past.Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students an parents make the right nutritional choices.Each student or staff who accesses the canteen could be provided with the School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have.Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike.Here again, diversity is the key. </p>

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Implemented Online Attendance Management System:This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school, instantly.Once the student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages.This helps schools keep a record of the student's absenteeism.Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin.The track has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and are not ready to estabilish coonectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculums subjects.As soon as you enter a students Enrollment Number or Namedetails like availibility in classes, number of lectures attended and will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities.Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span just after the admin enters login details into this tracker.All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confidental manner and at reduced costs.</p>
